- APOD: Shows off the current picture of the day with the information from the NASA APOD API
- Weather: Provides a current list of the weather in Mars for the week from the NASA Insight API
- Rovers: Has two choices of Rovers, once clicked it shows off the pictures taken by the specific robot and can be filtered by date. Makes use of the NASA Mars rovers API.
- Random: Allows access to the NASA image and video library API and displays 5 pictures every search with a hidden easter egg.
